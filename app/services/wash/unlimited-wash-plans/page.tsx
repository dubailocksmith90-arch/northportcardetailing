const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What does 'unlimited' mean exactly?",
    answer:
      "Unlimited means you can visit North Port Car Wash and run your vehicle through the tunnel wash as many times as you want within a calendar month, all covered by your flat monthly membership fee. There is no per-visit charge on top of the membership.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a contract or commitment?",
    answer:
      "No long-term contracts. Our unlimited wash membership is month-to-month. You can cancel at any time — call us at (941) 564-6447 to cancel before your next billing date.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I share my membership with a family member?",
    answer:
      "Memberships are tied to a single vehicle's license plate. Each vehicle that wants unlimited wash access would need its own membership. Call us to ask about multi-vehicle pricing.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I sign up?",
    answer:
      "Stop by North Port Car Wash at 14164 S Tamiami Trail and speak with our staff, or call us at (941) 564-6447 to set up your membership over the phone. We will activate your plan and link it to your vehicle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the unlimited membership worth it?",
    answer:
      "For regular drivers in the Tamiami Trail corridor — dealing with dust from US-41, salt air from the Gulf, or daily commuting grime — the membership typically pays for itself within a few washes per month. Florida's weather also means you may want to wash more often than you expect.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do members get free vacuums too?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Free self-serve vacuum bays are included with every wash visit for all customers, including members. There is no additional charge.",
  },

              <h2 className="font-['Barlow',sans-serif] font-bold text-xl text-white mb-3">Why Membership Makes Sense in Florida</h2>
              <p className="text-sm text-[#8C95A6] leading-relaxed mb-3">
                Florida vehicles face conditions that accelerate paint and finish deterioration faster than most of the country: intense daily UV, high humidity, salt air from the Gulf of Mexico, and frequent rain that leaves mineral deposits on paint. Drivers near North Port, Port Charlotte, and Venice who wash regularly preserve their paint longer and maintain resale value.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-[#8C95A6] leading-relaxed">
                With an unlimited membership, the cost-per-wash drops dramatically after just a few visits per month — making it the most economical option for anyone who cares about keeping their car clean year-round.
