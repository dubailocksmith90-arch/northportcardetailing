Our wheel detailing service removes brake dust, road grime, and tar buildup from wheel faces, spokes, and wheel arches using safe, non-acid wheel cleaners and dedicated detailing brushes."

          question: "Can your wheel cleaner damage powder-coated wheels?",
          answer:
            "We use iron/brake dust removers and pH-neutral wheel cleaners that are safe for powder-coated, painted, and polished aluminum wheels. We avoid harsh acid-based cleaners that can damage wheel finishes. If you have a rare or specialty finish, let us know when you call and we will confirm compatibility.",
        },
        {
          question: "How often should wheels be detailed?",
          answer:
            "For most daily drivers in the North Port area, a dedicated wheel detail every 2–3 months prevents significant brake dust buildup and etching. If you notice your wheels look dark or spotted after every wash, more frequent cleaning may be needed — especially on vehicles with performance brake pads that produce more dust.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do you clean the inside of the rim (the barrel)?",
          answer:
            "We clean the accessible parts of the barrel during a standard wheel detail. Full inside-barrel cleaning requires removing the wheel from the vehicle — this is available as a more comprehensive service. Call (941) 564-6447 to inquire.",
        },
        {
          question: "What causes the brown streaks on my rims?",
          answer:
            "The brown streaks on wheel faces are iron fallout — brake dust and environmental iron particles that have landed on the wheel and begun to oxidize. Iron removers chemically react with and dissolve these particles, making them dramatically easier to rinse away. Leaving them too long can cause pitting and permanent surface damage.",
