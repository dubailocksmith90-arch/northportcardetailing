      description="Ceramic coating bonds chemically to your vehicle's clear coat, creating a permanent hydrophobic layer that repels water, resists UV fading, blocks chemical etching, and makes your car significantly easier to clean. Unlike wax or sealant which sit on top of the paint and wear away within weeks or months, a professionally applied ceramic coating lasts years. It is the highest level of single-coat paint protection available."

          question: "How long does ceramic coating last?",
          answer:
            "A professionally applied ceramic coating typically lasts 2–5 years with proper maintenance, depending on the product grade, surface preparation quality, and how the vehicle is maintained. Some premium grades last even longer. In Florida's climate, the UV resistance of ceramic coating is particularly valuable.",
        },
        {
          question: "Does ceramic coating prevent scratches?",
          answer:
            "Ceramic coating adds a level of scratch resistance and reduces the risk of light marring, but it does not make paint scratch-proof. It protects against washing-induced swirls and environmental contamination, but a key scratch will still affect the coated surface.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do I still need to wash my car after ceramic coating?",
          answer:
            "Yes — ceramic coating makes washing easier and less frequent, but the car still needs washing. The difference is that dirt and water bead off much more easily, making touch-free or hand washing sufficient for most cleaning. Avoid automatic brush washes after coating.",
        },
        {
          question: "How does Florida's heat affect ceramic coating?",
          answer:
            "Ceramic coatings are engineered to handle high temperatures and are highly resistant to Florida's intense UV and heat. In fact, the UV blocking properties of ceramic coating are one of the primary reasons Gulf Coast vehicle owners choose it — to prevent paint oxidation and fading from sun exposure.",
        },
        {
          question: "Is ceramic coating worth it?",
          answer:
            "For vehicles driven in Florida's climate, the answer is often yes. Ceramic coating reduces paint oxidation, prevents water spotting, makes washing faster, and maintains resale value. The upfront cost is higher than wax, but it protects the investment in your vehicle for years rather than weeks.",
