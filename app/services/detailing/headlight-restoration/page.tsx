      description="Florida's intense UV exposure yellows and hazes plastic headlight lenses faster than almost anywhere else in the country. Within just a few years, factory headlights can become opaque enough to noticeably reduce nighttime visibility — and they look terrible. Our headlight restoration sands back the oxidized outer layer and polishes the lens to clear, followed by a UV sealant coat that slows re-oxidation."

          question: "How long will my restored headlights stay clear?",
          answer:
            "With the UV sealant coat we apply after polishing, most restored headlights remain clear for 1–2 years before showing signs of re-oxidation. This is a significant improvement over untreated sanded headlights, which can re-yellow within months. Annual touch-ups maintain the results.",
        },
        {
          question: "Why do headlights turn yellow in Florida?",
          answer:
            "Modern headlight lenses are made of polycarbonate plastic rather than glass. UV radiation breaks down the protective outer coating and then oxidizes the plastic itself, causing the yellow, hazy appearance. Florida's sun intensity — combined with daily exposure on a car sitting outside in the heat — accelerates this process dramatically compared to northern states.",
        },
        {
          question: "Is headlight restoration cheaper than replacement?",
          answer:
            "In virtually every case, yes. Replacement headlight assemblies for newer vehicles often cost $200–$600 or more per side. Professional restoration typically costs a fraction of that and restores the appearance and function close to new. Call us for current pricing.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do you restore taillights too?",
          answer:
            "Taillight restoration is possible on some vehicles depending on the lens material and condition. Call us at (941) 564-6447 to ask about your specific vehicle.",
