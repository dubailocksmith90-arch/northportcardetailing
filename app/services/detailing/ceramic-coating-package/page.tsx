const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Why is the Ceramic Coating Package different from just buying a ceramic coating?",
    answer:
      "The Package includes all the preparation steps that are required for a coating to perform correctly and last. Applying ceramic coating over uncorrected, contaminated paint is a common mistake that leads to poor adhesion, trapped defects, and shortened lifespan. Our package does everything right from the start.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the ceramic coating package take?",
    answer:
      "The full process takes 1–2 days. The actual application and initial flash are done in day one. Vehicles are typically kept overnight for initial cure and delivered the next day with a cure care guide.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long will the coating last after the package?",
    answer:
      "A professionally applied ceramic coating with correct prep work typically lasts 2–5 years in Florida's climate, depending on the product grade and how the vehicle is maintained. We use professional-grade coatings designed for longevity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I wash my car normally after the coating?",
    answer:
      "After the cure period (typically 7 days), you can wash the vehicle normally. We recommend hand wash or touchless wash — not brush-equipped tunnel washes, which can cause micro-marring of the coating surface over time. pH-neutral soap is best.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this package good for a new car?",
    answer:
      "New cars are ideal candidates — the paint is fresh, often in near-perfect condition, and coating it early provides protection from the first miles. We still perform decontamination and a light polish pass to remove any dealer-applied fillers or fine swirls from transport.",
  },
