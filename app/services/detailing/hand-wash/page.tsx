        {
          question: "Is hand wash better for ceramic-coated cars?",
          answer:
            "Yes — hand washing is the recommended maintenance method for ceramic-coated vehicles. Automatic brushes can scratch the coating over time, and some chemical washes contain ingredients that degrade ceramic coatings. A proper hand wash using two-bucket technique and pH-neutral soap maintains the coating's hydrophobic properties.",
        },
        {
          question: "Why not just use the tunnel wash?",
          answer:
            "Our tunnel wash is excellent for regular vehicles and everyday cleaning. However, for paint-sensitive vehicles — new cars, fresh paint jobs, ceramic-coated cars, and exotics — the controlled hand wash process eliminates any risk of contact-related swirl marks or chemical reactions.",
        },
        {
          question: "Is hand wash better for dark paint?",
          answer:
            "Dark paint shows swirl marks and micro-scratches more visibly than lighter colors. Hand washing with proper two-bucket technique and clean microfiber mitts is the safest way to clean dark paint without adding the swirl marks that tunnel brushes and careless washing can introduce.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need an appointment?",
          answer:
            "Yes — premium hand wash is a detailing service requiring an appointment. Call us at (941) 564-6447 to schedule. If you need a quick wash without scheduling, our 24/7 touchless bay or drive-through tunnel is available.",
