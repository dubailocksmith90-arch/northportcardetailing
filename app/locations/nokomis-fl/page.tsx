            North Port Car Wash is approximately 20 minutes south of Nokomis on US-41 (Tamiami Trail). Nokomis and Casey Key residents who travel south on the Trail — or who are heading toward North Port or Port Charlotte — pass directly through our corridor. We offer a tunnel wash, free vacuums, and professional detailing at 14164 S Tamiami Trail. With Nokomis Beach right on the Gulf, salt air protection is especially relevant for vehicles in this area.

            <p className="text-[#8C95A6] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              From Nokomis Beach or Casey Key, head to US-41 (Tamiami Trail) and continue south through Laurel and into North Port. We are at 14164 S Tamiami Trail — approximately 20 minutes from the Nokomis area.

            <p className="text-[#8C95A6] leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Nokomis&apos;s position directly on the Gulf Coast — with Casey Key extending into the Gulf and Nokomis Beach just steps from salt water — means vehicles here face above-average paint exposure. Salt particles carried by Gulf breezes settle on paint surfaces and accelerate oxidation. Our clay bar, paint sealant, and ceramic coating services remove and prevent this damage.
