    question: "How far is North Port Car Wash from Sarasota, FL?",
    answer:
      "From downtown Sarasota or St. Armands Circle, North Port Car Wash is approximately 35 minutes south via US-41 (Tamiami Trail) through Osprey and Nokomis into North Port. You can also take I-75 south to exit 182 and connect to US-41 heading north into North Port.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do Sarasota drivers use North Port Car Wash?",
    answer:
      "Sarasota residents who commute or travel south along the Tamiami Trail corridor find our location a natural stop. We offer a full tunnel wash, free vacuums, and professional detailing services — including ceramic coating and paint correction — that provide a comprehensive option beyond a quick express wash.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ceramic coating for Sarasota-area vehicles?",
    answer:
      "Yes — ceramic coating is one of our most popular services for vehicles from the Sarasota and Longboat Key area. The Gulf Coast salt air and UV exposure accelerate paint degradation, and a ceramic coating provides 2–5 years of protection. Call (941) 564-6447 to schedule a consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I schedule detailing from Sarasota without making a special trip?",
    answer:
      "Many Sarasota customers drop their vehicle off while running errands in North Port or Port Charlotte. We are open daily 7 AM – 7 PM and can accommodate same-week appointments in most cases. Call (941) 564-6447 to schedule.",

              From downtown Sarasota or the St. Armands Circle area, take US-41 (Tamiami Trail) south through Osprey and Nokomis, past Laurel, and continue into North Port. We are at 14164 S Tamiami Trail — approximately 35 minutes from most Sarasota locations.

              Alternatively, I-75 south to exit 182 (Jacaranda Blvd) connects easily to US-41. Sarasota&apos;s coastal position on Sarasota Bay and the Gulf means vehicles accumulate salt air exposure year-round — making paint protection services especially valuable for preserving your vehicle&apos;s finish and resale value.
