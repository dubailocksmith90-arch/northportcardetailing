            <p className="text-[#8C95A6] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Vehicles near Lemon Bay and Manasota Key face constant salt air exposure from the Gulf. Salt accelerates rust on exposed metal, pits clear coat, and degrades rubber seals faster than in inland areas. Regular washing and professional paint protection make a meaningful difference in how long your vehicle looks good and holds value.
