            <p className="text-[#8C95A6] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              From downtown Punta Gorda, cross over I-75 and take US-41 (Tamiami Trail) south through Port Charlotte and into North Port. We are on the right side of US-41 at 14164 S Tamiami Trail, about 25 minutes from most Punta Gorda neighborhoods. Punta Gorda&apos;s waterfront location on Charlotte Harbor means vehicles accumulate salt and humidity damage — making paint protection particularly valuable.
